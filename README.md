# Shinkansen-Travel-Experience
Hackathon

This is the problem of the Shinkansen (Bullet-Trains) of Japan. They aim to determine the relative importance of each parameter with regards to their contribution to the passenger travel experience. Provided is a random sample of individuals who traveled using their train. The on-time performance of the trains along with the passenger’s information is published in the CSV file named ‘Traveldata_train’.  These passengers were later asked to provide feedback on various parameters related to the travel along with their overall experience. These collected details are made available in the survey report CSV labeled ‘Surveydata_train’.

In the survey, a passenger was explicitly asked whether they were delighted with their overall travel experience and that is captured in the data of the survey report under the variable labeled ‘Overall_Experience’. 

This exercise aims to understand which parameters play an important role in swaying passenger feedback towards a positive scale. You are provided test data containing Travel data and Survey data of passengers. Both the test data and the train data are collected simultaneously and belong to the same company.
